I haven't updated this page in awhile; my bad. A lot has changed since I last was super active on here and I haven't fully known what I wanted to do with everything yet. I'm going to change some stuff up in the near future, mostly correcting some mistakes and privating projects I don't plan on working on for awhile or anymore.

I don't exactly know what I will do from then on, but I will update this repository if anything changes.

I'm still active on Discord (@Kirbout) and usually that's the best place to find me if anyone who still follows me on here wants to reconnect or ask questions.
